# Data for Democracy Project Ideas

Want to get involved in D4D? In addition to browsing our current active projects, we also have this list of project ideas.

These are project ideas submitted by members that might not have a leader yet (maybe it's you!) or that need to be developed out a bit more to get started. You can contribute to their development or put down your own ideas.

## Submit a New Project Idea

Got an idea for a new project and want to share it with our community? Get started by following these steps!

Take a quick look at our [existing project ideas](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/project-ideas/issues) to see if a similar idea already exists. If it does, feel free to click on the project, read the discussion, and add your comments!
If your idea isn't already listed, add it.

### Adding Your Idea

On the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/project-ideas/issues), click the green "New Issue" button.
Add a title and a description for your idea. The more info you can provide, the better! That will help other members understand your idea and be more inclined to jump on board.
Make sure to also add some labels to the project. This allows others to easily search the projects and to see what your idea might involve.
D4D community memebers will likely comment with some questions or feedback and next steps on how to get other members involved.

### Managing Your Project Idea

Try to keep your project idea active. If you can't commit time to managing the idea or leading the project itself, add the appropriate label to let people know. 
Don't worry if you don't have the time, it's great for us just to collect the awesome ideas that are alive in this community in the hope that they will get developed in the future.
