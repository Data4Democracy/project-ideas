# Data for Democracy Project Ideas

Want to get involved in D4D? In addition to browsing our current active projects, we also have this list of project ideas.

These are project ideas submitted by members that might not have a leader yet (maybe it's you!) or that need to be developed out a bit more to get started. You can contribute to their development or put down your own ideas.

## Browse Project Ideas

Thinking about starting a new project? Want to see what ideas other members have submitted? Check out project ideas [here](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/project-ideas/issues).

## Submit a New Project Idea

Got an idea for a new project and want to share it with our community? Get started by following these steps!

Take a quick look at our [existing project ideas](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/project-ideas/issues) to see if a similar idea already exists. If it does, feel free to click on the project, read the discussion, and add your comments!
If your idea isn't already listed, add it.

### Adding Your Idea

On the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/project-ideas/issues), click the green "New Issue" button.
Add a title and a description for your idea. Some useful details might be: purpose, data set(s), timeline, skillsets wanted/needed, external partner (y/n/who?) The more info you can provide, the better! That will help other members understand your idea and be more inclined to jump on board.



Make sure to also add some labels to the project. This allows others to easily search the projects and to see what your idea might involve.

You can also announce your project idea in slack to help build a team: #onboarding #project-ideas and on Fridays at the “official” project speed dating swap.

When you have a few people interested, create a channel for the project.

Request a github repo for your project in #github-support:  new projects have to fill out an ethical assessment (#ethics-general) to get started. It's intended to enhance our social impact mission at D4D! 

Start working together!

### Managing Your Project Idea

Try to keep your project idea active. If you can't commit time to managing the idea or leading the project itself, add the appropriate label to let people know. 
Don't worry if you don't have the time, it's great for us just to collect the awesome ideas that are alive in this community in the hope that they will get developed in the future.

### Other things to consider

As the project grows, consider doing one or more of the following:
Apply for grant funds.
Submit to a conference. 
Present your work at a meet-up or community event.
Write a blog post.
Write an academic paper.
